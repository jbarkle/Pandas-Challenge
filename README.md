## PyCity Schools Data Analysis

### Created a Jupyter Notebooks script to analyze the standardized test results and school budgets of PyCity Schools, which included the following:

- District Summary - summary of the district's key metrics

    - Total number of unique schools
    - Total students
    - Total budget
    - Average math score
    - Average reading score
    - % passing math (students who passed math)
    - % passing reading (students who passed reading)
    - % overall passing (students who passed math AND reading)

- School Summary - summary of key metrics about each school

    - School name
    - School type
    - Total students
    - Total school budget
    - Per student budget
    - Average math score
    - Average reading score
    - % passing math (students who passed math)
    - % passing reading (students who passed reading)
    - % overall passing (students who passed math AND reading)

- Additional metrics

    - Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    - Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
    - Math and Reading Scores by Grade
    - Scores by School Spending
    - Scores by School Size
    - Scores by School Type

Additionally, a written analysis was included that draws a few conclusions about the calculations, albeit may be a little subjective about the dataset.
